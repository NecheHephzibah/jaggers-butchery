### Project Background

### Project Background: Jagger's Butchery

In Nigeria, the traditional state of butchery has long been a cause for concern. Many butchery practices remain outdated, with little emphasis on hygiene, quality control, or adherence to health standards. It is not uncommon to find meat sold in open-air markets, exposed to flies, dust, and contamination. These unhygienic practices have led to numerous cases of foodborne illnesses, posing a significant risk to public health. Despite the vital role meat plays in the Nigerian diet, the industry has struggled to modernize and provide consumers with safe, high-quality options.

Jagger's Butchery was created to address these challenges and transform the way meat is processed, handled, and delivered. By introducing clean, hygienic, and standardized butchery practices, Jagger's Butchery aims to set a new benchmark for the industry. The platform ensures that all meat products meet stringent quality and safety standards, from slaughtering to packaging, guaranteeing freshness and nutrition.

What sets Jagger's Butchery apart is its:

- **Clean Environments**: Meat is processed in sanitized facilities, far removed from the traditional open-air setups.
- **High-Quality Standards**: Every step of the butchery process adheres to American standards for hygiene and safety.
- **Custom Cuts and Convenience**: Customers can order specific cuts and portions, tailored to their preferences, and delivered with precision.
- **Nutritious and Safe Products**: Meat is handled and stored to preserve its nutritional value while minimizing the risk of contamination.

Jagger's Butchery is not just about selling meat; it is about redefining an industry. By prioritizing health, hygiene, and customer satisfaction, it aims to restore confidence in meat consumption while championing a safer, healthier approach to butchery in Nigeria. This initiative represents a shift towards a cleaner, more modern future for meat production and distribution in the country.

## Technologies
Languages: HTML, CSS (Tailwind), JavaScript, Python

Framework, Libraries and Development Servers: React, Flask, SQLite, Tailwind and Vite.

For the frontend, I used **Tailwind CSS** for styling and ensuring responsive design, this enabled the creation of a clean, modern, and visually consistent user interface. I used **React** to build reusable UI components and implement dynamic interactions, such as updating product displays and managing user interactions seamlessly. Additionally, I used **JavaScript** for the client-side functionalities, ensuring a responsive and interactive user experience. **Vite** served as the development server, providing a fast and efficient development workflow with features like hot module replacement.

I used **Flask** for the backend develpment because of its simplicity and flexibility, making it easy to implement the application's business logic and RESTful APIs. **Python** provided a robust foundation for server-side operations, this will aid in the effecient response to customer's requests and orders. To store and manage data securely, I used **SQLite**, a lightweight and reliable database system that ensured quick access to product and order information. This backend architecture allowed for a seamless connection between the user interface and the server-side operations, ensuring a smooth overall experience for users.
